SystemInView
============

 This is a monitor running on Linux system.
 
============

 Notes:
 
 1.This software is written when I started to learn Qt. I used Qt-creator and CentOS.
 
 2.All of the code is written in C++.
 
 3.All the source files are put in the src directory. The project files, jpg files needed are
   put in the other directory.
   
 4.It's a monitor. It shows some basic information about your system,like cpu info, device info and many.
 
 5.It is used for learning Qt, and if you want to run it ,I suggest you that you should put all files in
   one directory, and make sure you haved installed Qt and Qt-creator, then compile it and run because
   no elf(EXEC) file exists here.
   
 6.Of course it's not a very good software, there might be bugs and I will keep improving it.
